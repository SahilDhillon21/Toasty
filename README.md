# Toasty - AI-Powered GitHub PR Assistant

# 1. Architecture Overview (Cloudflare Native)

### Core Flow

1. GitHub sends webhook → Cloudflare Worker
2. Worker validates signature
3. Worker fetches PR data from GitHub API
4. Worker sends structured context to AI agent
5. Worker stores results in Cloudflare storage
6. Worker posts AI review back to GitHub
7. Dashboard reads data from Cloudflare storage

# 2. Cloudflare-Based System Components

---

## 1. GitHub Repository

- Emits webhook events:
  - pull_request (opened, synchronize)
  - issue_comment (created)

- Sends events to Cloudflare Worker endpoint

---

## 2. Cloudflare Python Worker (Core Engine)

Replaces Django backend.

Responsibilities:

- Webhook validation
- Event routing
- PR metadata extraction
- GitHub API communication
- AI agent orchestration
- Posting comments back to GitHub
- Conversation tracking
- Security scanning triggers
- Priority score computation

Key Cloudflare features used:

- **Workers (Python runtime)**
- **KV (lightweight metadata storage)**
- **Durable Objects (conversation state & locking)**
- **D1 (structured relational data)**
- **R2 (optional diff storage for large PRs)**
- **Queues (async AI processing)**

---

## 3. AI Agent Service

Can be:

- External LLM API (OpenAI / Anthropic)
- Self-hosted inference
- Cloudflare AI (optional future enhancement)

Responsibilities:

- Smart prioritization scoring
- Code review analysis
- Security scanning
- Comment generation
- Thread summarization

---

## 4. Cloudflare Storage Design
